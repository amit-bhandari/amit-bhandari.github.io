# Privacy Policy for WhatsApp Direct Launch

**Last Updated: 8 June 2025**

Thank you for using WhatsApp Direct Launch ("App", "Service", "we", "us", "our"). This Privacy Policy describes how we handle information in connection with your use of our mobile application.

Your privacy is important to us. Our goal is to provide you with a useful service without unnecessarily collecting your personal data.

## 1. Information We Do Not Collect

WhatsApp Direct Launch is designed to be a simple utility. We **DO NOT** collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information from you, including but not limited to:

- Your name, email address, or other contact details.
- The phone numbers you enter into the App for the purpose of launching WhatsApp chats (these are processed locally on your device and used to construct the WhatsApp URL).
- Your contact list or address book.
- Your location data.
- Usage analytics that personally identify you.
- Any content of your WhatsApp messages (we do not have access to this).

## 2. Information We Collect (Locally Stored Data)

To enhance your user experience, the App locally stores a limited history of phone numbers you have successfully used to launch WhatsApp chats.

- **Recent Numbers History:** The phone numbers you enter and successfully use to launch a WhatsApp chat are stored **locally on your device** using your device's standard application storage mechanisms (e.g., SharedPreferences on Android).
- **Purpose:** This history is solely for your convenience, allowing you to quickly re-initiate chats with numbers you've recently contacted without re-typing them.
- **Control:** You can clear individual numbers from this history within the App.
- **Accessibility:** This locally stored history is not transmitted to us or any third party. It remains on your device.

## 3. How We Use Information

Since we do not collect personal information, we do not use it. The locally stored "Recent Numbers History" is used as described above:

- To display a list of recently used numbers within the App.
- To allow you to tap on a recent number to pre-fill the input field or directly launch a WhatsApp chat.

## 4. Third-Party Services

- **WhatsApp:** Our App uses WhatsApp's official public "click to chat" feature (`https://wa.me/`) to open chats. When you use our App to launch a WhatsApp chat, you are then interacting directly with WhatsApp. Your use of WhatsApp is subject to WhatsApp's own Privacy Policy and Terms of Service. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of WhatsApp.
- **URL Launcher:** The App utilizes a standard URL launching mechanism (e.g., Flutter's `url_launcher` package) to open the WhatsApp URL. This functionality is part of the operating system or standard libraries and does not involve us collecting your data.

## 5. Data Security

We take reasonable precautions to protect the information stored locally on your device by the App. However, please be aware that no method of electronic storage is 100% secure. The "Recent Numbers History" is stored in the App's private storage on your device.

## 6. Children's Privacy

Our App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13 (or a higher age threshold if stipulated by applicable laws in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children. If you believe that a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so that we can take steps to delete such information.

## 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
